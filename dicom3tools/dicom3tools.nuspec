	Command line utilities for creating, modifying, dumping and validating files of DICOM attributes, and conversion of proprietary image formats to DICOM. Can handle older ACR/NEMA format data, and some proprietary versions of that such as SPI.

	Image format support
	* DICOM offline file format as per Part 10, and auto-recognition of transfer syntax if no Part 10 meta information header.
	* Parsing/validating DICOM data sets as modules and IODs.
	* Creation/merging of DICOM datasets from text descriptions.
	* Creation of overlays and lookup tables.
	* Post scout lines, created 3D volumes from slices, orthogonal reprojection.
	* Build/dump DICOMDIR.
	* Dump DICOM Structured Reports.
	* Pbmplus extended 16 bit raw format, and PGX format.
	* Raw binary images.
	* Decompress JPEG and deflate transfer syntaxes (using external codecs).
	
	Test image generation ...
	* SMPTE patterns of arbitrary size and bit depth.
	* Briggs patterns of arbitrary size and bit depth.
	
	Proprietary image conversions from ...
	* General Electric CT High Speed Advantage (Genesis)
	* General Electric MR Signa 5X (Genesis)
	* General Electric Advantage Windows
	* General Electric CT Pace
	* Picker PQ/IQ CT
	* Siemens CT Somatom Plus family (Native)(incomplete)
